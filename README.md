#Make a Date
<br/><br/>
Made with React, Node.js, Yelp Fusion and Yelp's API, Javascript<br/>
Make a Date is a tool to help you <i>Make a Date!</i> Once you register, you can build a date by entering where you want to go, what you want to do, and what you want to eat. The app hits Yelp's API to return choices for both in the same location, you pick what looks good, then it saves it to your account.
<br/><br/>
Updates for the future:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Add better UI using Semantic React UI</li>
  <li>Integrate in Google Maps to show distance and directions between both parts of the date</li>
  <li>Make dates modular so you can add/remove additional things beyond the first two locations</li>
</ul>
